====================================

2)
Var – The JavaScript variables statement is used to declare a variable and,
      optionally, we can initialize the value of that variable.
      Example: var a =10; Variable declarations are processed before the execution of the code.
Const – The idea of const functions is not allow them to modify the object on
      which they are called. When a function is declared as const, it can be
      called on any type of object.
Let – It is a signal that the variable may be reassigned, such as a counter in
      a loop, or a value swap in an algorithm. It also signals that the
      variable will be used only in the block it’s defined in.



























































5)
What is a closure?
A closure is a feature in JavaScript where an inner function has access
to the outer (enclosing) function’s variables — a scope chain.

The closure has three scope chains:
- it has access to its own scope — variables defined between its curly brackets
- it has access to the outer function’s variables
- it has access to the global variables
