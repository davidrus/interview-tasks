Number: This represents number type values. The numbers are stored as floating-point values in TypeScript.

String: A string represents a sequence of characters stored as Unicode UTF-16 code.

Boolean: This represents a logical value. When we use the Boolean type, we get the output only in true or false.

Null: Null represents a variable whose value is undefined. It is not possible to directly reference the null type value itself.

Undefined: The Undefined type denotes all uninitialized variables.

Void: A void is the return type of the functions that do not return any type of value.
